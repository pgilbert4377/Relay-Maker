🏊‍♂️ Medley Relay Optimizer
This Python program uses sqlite3 to manage a database of swimmers and their individual stroke times. It automatically sorts swimmers into age/gender-specific tables and computes the fastest possible combination of swimmers for a medley relay. The relay includes one swimmer each for backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle—ensuring each swimmer is unique and only fills one stroke.

🚀 Features
✅ Add and organize swimmers by age, gender, and name

✅ Automatically stores times for all four strokes (free, back, breast, fly)

✅ SQLite3-powered backend for persistent, structured data

✅ Finds the fastest legal medley relay combination (no duplicate swimmers)

✅ Works for any age/gender group stored in the database

🧠 How it Works
Swimmers are entered into a database table named by age and gender (e.g., eightumale).

Each swimmer record includes:

fname, lname (first and last name)

free_time, back_time, breast_time, fly_time

absent (optional flag for availability)

The program evaluates all possible combinations of 4 different swimmers, one per stroke.

It calculates the total relay time for each valid combination and returns the fastest one.
